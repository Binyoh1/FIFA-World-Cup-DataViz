This project aims to gain the following insights:
- Build a dataset with World Cup host, winner and top scoring team for each edition of the World Cup (1930-2018)
- How often does the top scoring team win the World Cup.
- How often does the host nation win the World Cup.
- Visualize data of total goals scored in every edition of the World Cup from 1930-2018 indicating the number of participating teams in each edition of the tournament.
- Visualize data of total goals scored and conceded by each nation in every edition of the World Cup since inception in 1930 to 2018.
- Observe any noticeable trends and deviations from said trends across World Cup editions.
  - For any observable deviations, what were some interesting stories surrounding those particular World Cup editions.
- Finally, creating a web app that displays important/interesting visuals


### Current Task
- Updating web app visualizing interesting insights in plot and table format

I used Streamlit to build the interactive web app for this project. However it's worth noting that other platforms and libraries exist to perform the same or similar task including but not limited to Plotly Dash, Panel, and Flask.

As such, I went with the more beginner friendly Streamlit to build the web app.
