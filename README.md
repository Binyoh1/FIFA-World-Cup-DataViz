This project aims to gain the following insights:
- Build a dataset with World Cup host, winner and top scoring team for each edition of the World Cup (1930-2018)
- What is the probability of the top scoring team winning the World Cup.- What is the probability of the host nation's team winning the World Cup.
- Visualize data of total goals scored in every edition of the World Cup from 1930-2018 indicating the number of participating teams in each edition of the tournament.
- Visualize data of total goals scored and conceded by each nation in every edition of the World Cup from 1930-2018.
- Observe any noticeable trends and deviations from said trends across World Cup editions.
  - For any observable deviations, what were some interesting stories surrounding those particular World Cup editions.


### Current Task
- Building a web app visualizing interesting insights in plot and table format

I originally started creating the app layout using Plotly Dash, but came to the realization that creating the HTML & CSS properties would be very cumbersome (though I have some proficiency with both languages), also, the code would get extremely untidy (and that is before I start adding the data processing/wrangling).

As such, I went with the more beginner friendly route of using Streanlit to build the web app. As soon as the app is deployed, the linked would be made available.
