- Observe any noticeable trends and deviations from said trends across World Cup editions.
  - For any observable deviations, what were some interesting stories surrounding those particular World Cup editions.
- Finally, creating a web app that displays some interesting insights into the FIFA World Cup over the years


# Note
I used Streamlit to build the interactive web app for this project. However it's worth noting that other platforms and libraries exist to perform the same or similar task including but not limited to Plotly Dash, Panel, and Flask.

As such, I went with the more beginner friendly Streamlit to build the web app.
